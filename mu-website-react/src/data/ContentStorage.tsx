      "Assoc. Prof. Taweechai Amornsakchai and team receive prestigious recognition for sustainable rubber innovation.",
    content: `üéâ Congratulations! üéâ
The National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT), via the 2025 Bangkok International Intellectual Property, Invention, Innovation and Technology Exposition (IPITEx2025), has awarded a Gold Medal to Assoc. Prof. Taweechai Amornsakchai and his research team, including Assoc. Prof. Sombat Thanawat, Prof. Pranee Phinyocheep, Mr. Satit Thaiwattananon, Asst. Prof. Preeyanuch Junkong, Mr. Sorn Duangsuwan, and Mr. Wongsathon Saitrong. These esteemed instructors and students from the Polymer Science and Technology Program, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University were recognized for their outstanding invention, "PiPreg-R".

This innovative work was showcased at the Bangkok International Intellectual Property, Invention, Innovation, and Technology Exposition during Thailand Inventors' Day 2025 (February 2‚Äì6, 2025).

üîπ What is PiPreg-R?
PiPreg-R is a sustainable reinforced rubber innovation that integrates pineapple leaf fibers with natural rubber to create a low-carbon, eco-friendly material. It enhances flexibility, elasticity, and reinforcement without requiring energy-intensive processes. Delivered as unidirectional tapes compatible with standard manufacturing equipment, PiPreg-R offers versatile applications‚Äîfrom handicrafts to high-performance engineering‚Äîaligning with modern sustainability goals.
