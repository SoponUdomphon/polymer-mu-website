Prof. Taweechai Amornsakchai and his research team, including Assoc. Prof. Sombat Thanawat, Prof. Pranee Phinyocheep, Mr. Satit Thaiwattananon, Asst. Prof. Preeyanuch Junkong, Mr. Sorn Duangsuwan, and Mr. Wongsathon Saitrong. These esteemed instructors and students from the Polymer Science and Technology Program, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University were recognized for their outstanding invention, \"PiPreg-R\".\r\n\r\nThis innovative work was showcased at the Bangkok International Intellectual Property, Invention, Innovation, and Technology Exposition during Thailand Inventors' Day 2025 (February 2–6, 2025).\r\n\r\n🔹 What is PiPreg-R?\r\nPiPreg-R is a sustainable reinforced rubber innovation that integrates pineapple leaf fibers with natural rubber to create a low-carbon, eco-friendly material. It enhances flexibility, elasticity, and reinforcement without requiring energy-intensive processes. Delivered as unidirectional tapes compatible with standard manufacturing equipment, PiPreg-R offers versatile applications—from handicrafts to high-performance engineering—aligning with modern sustainability goals.\r\n\r\n📌 Learn more about PiPreg-R here:\r\n🔗 Watch the video: https://youtu.be/s9hbZY-jdvg\r\n💻 Visit our website: https://evergentech.co/\r\n\r\n👏 Congratulations once again to
